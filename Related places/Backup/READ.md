## This backup version was made during the Crosswoods hacking incident.
You were teleported into this place during the incident so the main game wouldn't hack you, which was VERY VERY VERY unlikely, considering 
the hackers behind it weren't even going for small games like OAI, more like bigger games with ~100k visits.
